This was a project to test my ability to apply python loops to an indirect mathematical function. The code to generate the prime list was taken from a website  (cited in the code comments) and the original code is also marked by comments to preserve integrity. The code trims down the prime list whenever it invalidates a prime for being greater than the target value, or already applied to the original target number, so that it cuts down on iterations. This is my attempt at incorporating memory retention.
